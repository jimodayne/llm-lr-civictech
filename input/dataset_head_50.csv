This work explores how the development of an embodied river persona, a farming assistant app, and a community hazard mapping tool could pose challenges and aid successes to respective local communities. Our design fiction highlights issues of design and development challenges that local organizations might face in a varied AI development for the environment. We explore questions around incorporating traditional knowledge, ethical participatory design models, and challenges of implementing and sustaining tools. Our work demonstrates how design fiction might be used to imagine AI for the climate challenge that considers people, place, and community.  © 2025 Owner/Author."

After pointing out Goffman's singular conception of the “interaction order,” the author shows how institutional organizers and ordinary citizens deal with interactional ambiguity, in its contrasting effects on the dynamics of these participatory assemblies. A primary form of ambiguity, between a “representative” and a “deliberative” definition of participatory democracy, is proving inhibiting for citizens' involvement and tends to “suspend interaction.” A second type of ambiguity arises from a wide range of facilitation methods (playful, dramaturgical, educational, therapeutic, esthetic, etc.) designed to transform the initial ambiguity to offer more fluid interaction and more stimulating involvement opportunities, yet in an activity that now has only an uncertain connection to civic participation. The author concludes by presenting some frame-analytical tools for tracking and evaluating dynamics of ambiguity transformation in participatory processes and emphasizes the implications of this type of sociological analysis for political theory. © 2024 Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI)."

The research used L. Starkey’s test of critical thinking, observation, and conversation to study the ability to comprehend texts critically. Such criteria as the ability to argue a position, the depth of the analysis, the independence of the analysis, the level of difference between the results of one’s own cognitive search and theoretical constructs from textbooks, and the quality of reflection were studied. Each of the criteria was evaluated at three levels—low, medium and high. The formative experiment made it possible to test the formulated hypothesis. The experiment’s independent variable is a system of exercises aimed at developing critical thinking, which involves the use of multimedia technologies. The dependent variable is the critical thinking of education seekers. In general, the research hypotheses were confirmed, as the experimental programme demonstrated effectiveness depending on the students’ year of study. A gradual increase in the values of the studied components during undergraduate studies is recorded. The developed programme began to partially demonstrate effectiveness starting from the second year, and the greatest positive effect was recorded in the fourth year. The use of multimedia technologies provided additional developmental opportunities for the development of critical thinking in students’ work with text material. At the same time, critical reading of texts turned out to be more sensitive to pedagogical influence, compared to critical thinking in general. The obtained data can be used to strengthen the developmental effect of educational programmes of HEIs. In particular, experimental data will help to optimize the teaching of educational components in the context of developing students’ critical thinking and active civic position in the information field. The practical aspect of increasing distance learning opportunities is especially important. Further research prospects are to determine the effectiveness of using multimedia technologies for the development of students’ critical thinking when studying different academic subjects. © 2024 by the author(s).

As the phenomenon is widely recognized in papers presenting singular case studies and broader analyses in the field, selecting such serious games with certain characteristics remains unclear. The informed process of choosing games with particular properties regarding genesis, graphic style, genre, and complexity as the response for specified needs and process assumptions appears to be supportive in preventing unnecessary costs and data overproduction. Such avoidance is an important part of sustainable digital transformation. Therefore, there is a need for a more conscious process of selecting video games to be used in a participatory process. The following paper aims to propose a numerical base for a decisional instrument that could be useful for specifying the characteristics of games to be utilized in participation. They performed a multicriteria analysis of documented cases of implementing video games in civic engagement, allowing the creation of a set of numeric indicators that help determine the properties of games that will be most appropriate for given process assumptions. Such a tool can prevent overproducing data on the one hand and may cause dissemination of the presented way of handling the participation process on the other. © 2024 by the author."

It addresses two research questions: “How did it emerge?” and “How has it continued until today?”. Through interviews with 50 activists across Asia, the study argues that the MTA networks were developed and nurtured over many years, rather than being solely facilitated by digital communication technologies. The study identifies two key networks: the triangular network among Hongkonger, Taiwanese, and Thai youth activists, and the Network of Young Democratic Asians (NOYDA). While the triangular network was crucial in the early days, the NOYDA network became a key actor after the 2021 military coup in Myanmar. By using network analysis and a transnational historical approach, the study provides a more nuanced explanation of the recent wave of youth and student political activism in Asia. It also highlights the grassroots interconnectedness between East and Southeast Asia in the contemporary period. © 2024 Phattharathanasut."

The relevance of the study is determined by the need to develop prosocial behavior in young people as one of the main conditions for developing harmonious social relations in modern Russian society. The global trend toward implementing the idea of prosociality in education as a tool for developing prosocial communities is supported by leading global institutions and projects focused on the education system and upbringing of young people (for example, OECD Future of Education and Skills 2030, Global Education Futures). The study aims to identify the regulatory conditions for developing prosociality in a modern Russian comprehensive school. Materials and methods. The source base of the study was the regulatory documents defining the state policy of the Russian Federation in the field of education and upbringing in comprehensive schools (federal laws, decrees of the government of the Russian Federation, the Federal State Educational Standard of Basic General Education, the Concepts of academic subjects “Fundamentals of the Spiritual and Moral Culture of the Peoples of Russia”, “History of Russia”, “Social Science”, methodological recommendations and materials developed by the Ministry of Education, and administrative documents of the central education authorities in the Russian Federation). During the study, a systematic approach was used, as well as scientific research methods: textual analysis, the comparison method, and the historical and genetic method. Results. The studied corpus of documents displayed normative regulation of activities to develop prosociality as a moral quality in line with the paradigm of the humanistic nature of education. Forming the civic activity of schoolchildren as an integral part of prosocial behavior is possible through the participation of schoolchildren in solving national problems, primarily in the format of volunteering. The greatest attention in Russian legislation is paid to issues of patriotic education of youth. Conclusion. A phenomenon of modern education is prosocial attitudes being introduced into the consciousness of young people, understood as a person’s ability to help others, take an active civic position, and act in the external environment. © 2024 LLC Ecological Help.

An important concept developed in this paper is that of digital democracy, and as such, a thorough analysis will be done on technological advancements, which have so far proved very instrumental in promoting civic participation and entailing more involvement in the democratic process by all concerned through online voter registration, mobile phone applications, and social media campaigns. The article, therefore, pinpoints studies showing that states that have adopted online registration actually report higher rates of active voters, while mobile apps present information that makes voting more manageable. Social media also offers an effective outreach opportunity, particularly among younger voters, to create in them a sense of community and urgency about participation in electoral activity. The integration of educational tools, such as virtual workshops and gamified learning, enables further development of the capability to push participants and voters forward in an accessible and engaging manner. The article leverages these advantages of technological developments as a means toward creating a better-informed and more active electorate contributing to the health of democracy. © The Research Publication,."

Unlike Vesuvius and Stromboli, the Phlegraean Fields threat is not readily visible, and public awareness of volcanic danger and the civic emergency plan is correspondingly quite limited. Recent increased levels of regional seismic activity have concentrated attention on enhancing public volcano risk awareness, especially among younger generations. Recognizing the influential role of the younger demographic in societal scientific awareness, effective language and engagement strategies become paramount. In this context, Serious Games, which balance serious and playful elements, emerge as an innovative science communication tool actively involving participants and enhancing their learning experience. Integral to risk analysis is the use of downward counterfactual analysis, a cognitive psychology concept that prompts a deliberate examination of how events might have taken a more adverse turn. This approach contributes to enhanced disaster preparedness, particularly for extreme natural risks such as volcanic eruptions. An interactive Victorian parlor game was designed for the 2023 edition of the Science Fair “Futuro Remoto” in Bagnoli, in the Phlegraean Fields. This game aims to elevate risk awareness, offering participants an instructive and engaging experience focused on counterfactual thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills development. The initiative places participants at the core of the learning process, fostering not only the acquisition of scientific knowledge but also individual risk intelligence. An evaluation protocol has been developed to assess the impact of the experience on risk perception, with outcomes to be presented after the 2023 edition of “Futuro Remoto,” where nearly 200 participants engaged in the game. © 2024 The Authors"

A detailed literature review gathered from leading databases, articles, and case studies was conducted to achieve the study’s objective. After evaluating the literature and utilizing reducing methods the factors were organized and categorized into the four SWOT groups. The study exhibits that the government of Bangladesh has taken multiple approaches to efficient usage of their resources and providing primary healthcare services at grassroots levels. However, compared to a developing country like Malaysia it is far lag and struggling with multiple challenges like inadequate ICT infrastructure interoperability issues, low adoption of services, privacy and trust issues inadequate data security lack of policies and regulations, and insufficient funding along with multiple threats like resistance to change, cultural influence, and native environmental issues. Nonetheless, these challenges can be addressed through the development of adequate infrastructure, technology, financial support, and human resource capabilities. This will help to achieve the goal of universal health coverage and digital healthcare. This paper identified and explored numerous eHealth concerns and institutionalized favorable policy recommendations to establish an effective and successful eHealth system and boost the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh and similar emerging economies.

Indonesia's smart city policies are still unsustainable and sectoral. This study aims to (i) identify the smart city categories essential for municipalities in Indonesia, (ii) determine the information needs of municipalities in supporting smart city initiatives, and (iii) formulate an integrated information system implementation model tailored to municipalities in Indonesia. Data were collected in Pariaman City, West Sumatra, Indonesia, using questionnaires, focus group discussions (FGD), and interviews. The findings reveal that the top three smart city categories, prioritized in order, are Data Centers & Analytics, Government Planning & Policy Design, and Education Facilities. These ideas are valuable for guiding the development of a smart city strategy within the Municipality by emphasizing key priorities such as data centers, analytics, government planning, education, health amenities, and online civic services.

However, much of the mathematics that students find in the primary school curriculum falls short to support that need. This lack of curriculum alignment with global needs has implications for the development of communities, but they are much more severe for students from underserved populations who systematically suffer different types of exclusions that increase their social disadvantages. This study explores the traits of global citizenship that students from underserved populations exhibit as they progress through a learning experience with open civic data on a global issue (climate change). The learning experience was used as the basis for an individual interview with five participants (9–10 years old) from public schools in low-income neighborhoods of a metropolitan area in northern Colombia. Participants were offered a dataset (data) ready to use and they were asked to undertake data handling actions (data-ing) using freely available web-based software. Participants were asked “What does this dataset say?” and their verbal statements were analyzed. The main findings suggest that in data and data-ing on open civic data reflecting global issues, participants exhibited understanding, belonging and action which are traits of global citizenship. In terms of understanding, participants described the behavior of the variables, suggested informal inferences, and made associations between variables. In terms of belonging and action, participants’ statements suggested including themselves as part of the community, taking responsibility, and proposing transformative actions. © The Author(s) 2025."

At present, many performance appraisal methods lack objectivity and fairness, which is not conducive to the long-term development of enterprises. Therefore, more research into scientific and effective performance appraisal methods is required. This study takes the grassroots employees of Enterprise A as an example, improving the existing performance appraisal evaluation indices to evaluate employee performance from three dimensions, including achievement, ability, and attitude, as determined by index weights using the analytic hierarchy process approach. An improved backpropagation neural network (BPNN) method is then designed to obtain performance appraisal and evaluation results. The error between the output of the improved BPNN method and expected output was small. Of the 20 extracted samples, the maximum and minimum error values were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively, and the average error was 0.03.

It emphasizes the importance of placing nonviolent activities within leadership frameworks that prioritize collectivity, collaboration, adaptiveness, authenticity, and community interactions. It argues that non-violent activism can serve as a cornerstone of democratic practices, and plausible to a myriad of challenges in civic spaces. The assertion that violence is not a prerequisite for gaining the attention of authorities capable of enacting societal change is supported by several studies. This paper advocates for a reorientation of collaborative efforts between those in positions of authority and civil society leaders to foster progress. There is power in the decibel of voices of the people, to correct acts of omission and commission that is impacting negatively on the citizens. In context characterized by volatility and fragility, the paper suggests prioritizing the process of influencing, mobilizing and organizing responsive interventions rather than solely focusing on the ends or outcomes. Process-oriented approach creates containers for curiosity, relational, and experimental practices that interweave multi-dimensional perspectives. The social change actors navigated cultural and structural barriers to implement non-violent strategies, offering a compelling example of grassroots peace building. Overall, this paper findings underscores the significance of understanding both direct and structural violence in shaping citizen’s right within specific context. It highlights the efficacy of context-based leadership practices in promoting non-violent organizing for peace, particularly in hyperlocal settings. Moreover, it suggests that these findings could inform indigenous peace building that is inherently influenced by contextual factors. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a case study, I was able to elucidate a context-based leadership model advanced by local women that averted a probable political violence in Nigeria. A case study approach was adopted because it is a phenomenon that is bounded in time, context and advanced by a particular group of change agents. A case study with a constructivist approach was utilized to understand the context and sense making of the “why” and the “what”. In situatedness, the natural occurring data was cultivated, including one-on-one indepth interviews. Data was analyzed using a narrative analysis, which raised themes on resilience, collectivity, collaboration, risk and sustainability. The findings pivot a culturally based experience of leadership by women in a fragile context. First, I provided a contextual background, explaining the local context, including the socio-economic, cultural, political and historical factors that contributed to the emergence of the conflict. In addition, I explained the scope and nature of the conflict, describing the grievances and issues that led to the tensions within the community, and highlighting the key actors and stakeholders involved. Secondly, I analyzed the non-violent strategies and tactics employed by a group of social change actors to address the issue which involved non-violent protest, tactical community organizing, dialogic engagements and creative forms of interventions. Thirdly, I evaluated and explained the role of leadership in coordinating non-violent activities and actions, the effectiveness of their leadership style, relational and processual, that sustained the non -violent approach, and the challenges the group encountered. In addition, I explained the outcome from such leadership practice and lessons learned, with evidence of a dismantling of power dynamics, and shift in attitude to a non-violent disposition. Lastly, I explained how this approach may have broader implications for understanding nonviolent conflict resolution, social movements, and the promotion of peace and justice in local contexts and beyond. Findings: A leadership practice that is relational and collective should have consideration for both the context where the leadership is exercised and deliberate on the processes necessary to hold containers for everyone to engage. This is gradually dismantling the hegemonic conceptualization of peace building, with a gradual shift of co-construction and sense making of peace building, with implication for more diversity and inclusion of persons and perspectives. It also underscores a system that deconstructs and departs form colonized thinking and contributes to conditions that enables and inspires alternative approaches to addressing oppressive power structures. (1) In unstable situations, leadership frequently arises from within communities, driven by individuals and groups intimately connected to their realities. The Nassarawan women embody this grassroots leadership, marked by wisdom, resilience, and a dedication to creating positive change despite significant obstacles. They embrace non-violent strategies, inspired by past successes, recognizing their potency in effecting change. (2) The leadership of these women illustrates the importance of mobilizing collective strength for justice and equality, showcasing how local leadership can catalyze transformative change for the better. (3) Indigenous styles of leadership possess the capacity to go beyond conventional concepts and embrace intricacy, flexibility, and inclusiveness. A multi-faceted leadership strategy becomes especially pertinent as it enables individuals to navigate complexity, confront challenges, and cultivate resilience within their communities, rather than depending solely on traditional methods.(4) The practice of peace leadership isn’t necessarily linked to official positions, titles, or authority. Rather, it appears as a continuous, intentional effort within community interactions, often arising from unexpected situations and sources. Research limitations/implications: Most of the women engaged in this leadership activity are located in remote areas, and this research had access to only a few who storied their experiences in ways they understood how to. Practical implications: With the rapid shift and call for more non-violent activism, we must be open to sample the different textures relevant for varied conditions. This holds a huge implication for understanding the psychology of communities expressing the full human agency in exercising leadership that is contextually driven. The connection between local struggles and global movements for social justice and human rights is profound and multifaceted. Firstly, there’s a shared value across movements for equity, equality, justice, dignity, and human rights, spanning issues like environmental protection, gender equality, racial justice, and indigenous rights. Local movements increasingly emphasize building solidarity across borders, collaborating with similar movements worldwide through actions like protests and social media campaigns. This amplifies local voices on a global stage and underscores the interconnectedness of struggles. The leadership of the women’s group holds significant implications for global movements, offering insights into grassroots perspectives on social issues. Their localized knowledge enriches global discourse on social change, providing tangible examples of challenges faced by marginalized groups and culturally relevant solutions. Additionally, their commitment to nonviolent methods establishes a platform for marginalized voices and fosters solidarity across diverse communities. The group’s innovative approaches, drawing upon local resources and grassroots networks, demonstrate the power of community-driven solutions to address social problems. Moreover, their grassroots empowerment shifts power dynamics within communities and influences broader systemic transformations, all while advocating for justice through peaceful means. These practices not only spark global solidarity but also shape public discourse and policy agendas at state and national levels, highlighting the human rights implications of local issues like political corruption. Overall, the women’s group exemplifies the transformative potential of grassroots activism in effecting lasting change on a global scale. Social implications: The power for everyday peace leadership rests with the people and it is translated into meaningful outcomes when everyone has the opportunity to lead. Originality/value: Research has been done on many women led movement in Nigeria, but this is unique, as it changed the narrative for an approach that was successful in shifting cultural boundaries in very fragile and uncertain context. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Especially in traditional villages with national protection status, the cognitive differences between individuals and the state aggravate the conflicts and trust crisis between grassroots organizations and villagers in the construction of rural housing. Simmel believes that trust is a leap of knowledge and belief under the joint action of rationality and sensibility. Many scholars have tried to analyze and deconstruct the “leap of trust” from multiple disciplines, but there are few practical cases, and the specific path with the rural background of China is not clear. The purpose of this study is to study the reconstruction of trust in village by focusing on the co-construction of villages, because the mode of co-construction of village is not only in line with traditional cultural customs, but also the main trend of promoting rural development in China. Based on the empirical investigation of rural housing construction in Tangfang Village, Yunnan Province, China, this paper studies the links among trust remodeling, university participation and multi-subject co-construction, and explores the elements and path of trust construction under the intervention of the third party of universities in rural construction. The empirical analysis points out that there are six elements of trust construction in the multi-subject co-construction of traditional village, including moral integrity, interest relationship, knowledge and technology, achievement expectation, value sharing and daily interaction, and the dynamic process of rural trust construction accompanied by multi-subjects eating, living and working together goes through four stages, namely, no trust, rational trust, experience trust and deep trust. There are two conclusions in this paper. Firstly, participating in rural construction can construct the trust relationship between university team members and villagers. Secondly, as a third-party media, universities can help to rebuild the trust relationship between villagers and grassroots organizations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

It considers diverse sites and institutions, revealing a complex, interconnected web of knowledge spaces – dissenting academies, teaching hospitals, learned societies, independent libraries and individual initiatives – which complicate existing narratives of the development of higher education in the city that usually focus on the origins of the university. In the early nineteenth century, with Manchester rapidly becoming the ‘world’s first industrial city’, we see emerging at the same time a vibrant urban educational landscape, with no parallel in the British Isles at that time.1 In contrast to England’s ancient universities which remained, for the most part, closed and private entities until the mid-nineteenth century, Manchester’s educational culture was self-consciously diffused, civic and participatory, strongly influenced by the city’s prominent dissenting communities. Excluded from Oxford and Cambridge, Manchester’s Unitarians, in particular, sought to shape the city’s educational culture according to the Enlightenment ideal of polite learning as a public endeavour. While civic participatory models have been foregrounded by historians of knowledge and ideas in recent years, this article considers, for the first time, how such models influenced the history of educational cultures in Manchester. © 2024 Manchester University Press.

However, their geographical position often renders them vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. This work assesses the potential of Living Labs (LL) as user-centred open innovation environments, in which multiple stakeholders systematically revision the currently existing port infrastructure and co-create solutions for enhancing resilience against climate-induced hazards. In respect to the previous, and in the context of the scientific project “Resports”, 3 Living Labs (LLs) are established in equal number of Greek Ports, Chios, Volos and Heraklion. The Quadruple Helix Participation Model of Partnership is followed, involving stakeholders from Academia, Industry, Governments and Civic Society. Based on these three LLs, this study describes their framework, reports their key-findings and discusses their implications for the Ports Industry Ecosystem. Main benefits resulting from the qualitative analysis of LLs for fostering resilience of Greek ports include the acceleration of research and innovation; the mapping and validation of processes through engagement with diverse stakeholders which often may have conflicting objectives; the risk mitigation achieved by testing novel solutions in a controlled environment; and the facilitation of knowledge transfer across different partners within the port industry ecosystem. Thus, LLs emerge as indispensable platforms to promote co-creation, adaptability, innovation, and collaboration, propelling maritime ports toward a more sustainable and resilient future in response to the evolving challenges posed by climate change. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In recent years, many forms of e-participation have emerged, and space for experiments with visual and interactive technologies has been created. However, research evaluating e-participation technologies in energy transitions is lacking. This study uses interviews with 33 stakeholders in a planned wind farm project, combined with online survey results, to derive empirical insights into attitudes towards and preferences for e-participation. On the one hand, we observe openness towards new options for creative input and visualization-based online tools and virtual realities. On the other hand, stakeholders fear vulnerabilities and are skeptical about the efficacy of online discourse. Institutional stakeholders primarily see risks in civic participation, while citizens themselves see the benefits. Unexploited potential for creative input, deliberation, and collaborative planning could be leveraged to increase democratic legitimacy. In this context, better outputs are not synonymous with accepting outcomes, but can include changes to or even rejection of plans based on public preferences and concerns.

The impact on trust towards village cadres is significant only when democracy involves all villagers in a village. We show two mechanisms that improve villagers’ trust: the “privatization” effect, where democratic decision-making leads to more land devolved to villagers, and the “conflict-resolving” effect, where improved information and cohesion by mass participation helps resolve inter-village land disputes.

However, the widespread availability of data has outpaced citizens' ability to effectively utilize it, underscoring the need for data literacy skills, especially among youth. This paper addresses the gap in data literacy by proposing an innovative teaching approach that leverages map-based storytelling to engage young people and enhance their data literacy. By integrating real-world open datasets into interactive visual narratives, this approach aims to captivate young audiences, develop critical thinking skills, and foster a deeper understanding of socio-economic issues. Through a case study of a Datathon project titled “Croatian Youth vs. EU: Who has it better?”, this research demonstrates the efficacy of combining data visualization and storytelling to promote data literacy and civic engagement.

Purpose: This study aimed to assess the impact on students in participating in voluntary semester-long service-learning labs and courses in comparison to traditional labs and courses. Methodology/Approach: A quantitative online survey was administered to 110 students at the beginning and end of the lectures, investigating four psychosocial variables of citizenship: social justice attitude, cognitive empowerment, sense of community responsibility, and civic engagement. The post-survey also collected data on the participants’ quality of participation experiences. Findings/Conclusions: Analyses performed on data revealed no statistically significant group differences over time in all examined variables, except for the quality of participation experiences, where service-learning students scored significantly higher than other students. Factors potentially influencing these results include the students’ perception of their competence, the duration of the service-learning program, and relying on self-reported measures. Implications: This study contributes to the advancement of experiential learning knowledge emphasizing the significance of methodological rigor, underpinning a narrative that leverages failure to foster understanding.

Studies show that learning experiences connecting students to the community promote active citizenship, social justice, and human rights efforts. Events such as Legislative Education and Advocacy Day (LEAD) expose social work students to the legislative and advocacy process with the intention to promote civic engagement and enhance social work advocacy skills. This study utilized photovoice as a community-based action research approach to explore the impact of LEAD on social work students’ engagement, advocacy skills, connection to the social work community, and perceptions of advocacy. Participants were asked to take photographs of their experiences, provide insight into the photos, and participate in a debriefing session. An analysis of the discussion around the photographs identified ten thematic codes suggesting that events such as LEAD can be a tool utilized by social work educators to enhance student understanding of advocacy (approaches, perspective, and engagement), development of advocacy skills (skills and processes), social work identity (purpose, support for the voiceless, and community), and social justice efforts to create agents of change. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

This study bridges CI theory with technical implementation through a novel framework combining blockchain and AI technologies. Our approach maps core CI components (knowledge capital, system capital, and relational capital) to specific technical solutions: a civic engagement index for measuring participation quality, a tokenization framework for incentivizing meaningful engagement, and a governance optimization function for resource allocation. Using mixed-methods research, we developed and validated the conceptual CI governance (CIG) framework, which satisfies CI principles through smart contracts and AI-assisted interfaces. The empirical evaluation demonstrates both social and technical improvements: 40% increased civic participation rates, 85% governance efficiency maintenance, and significant gains in engagement quality metrics (knowledge sharing +32%, collective decision making +28%). While technical implementation shows promise, success requires the careful integration of social dynamics, digital literacy initiatives, and regulatory compliance.

Digital advancements have transformed the European public sphere and are radically changing democratic deliberation by enhancing access to information, facilitating transnational dialogue and fostering new forms of civic engagement. E-governance and digital public services streamline administrative processes, making it more convenient for citizens to access various services. Digitalisation of interaction among EUs’ citizens can support their mobility and connectivity. However, rapid digital advancement also brings challenges of evolving multifaced EU identity in fast paced, post-truth, increasingly complex social system like the EU. The main goal of this article is to show the relevance of postmodern theories for the creation of a theoretical framework for digital European citizenship and the digital European public sphere. By embracing complexity, encouraging critical reflexion and prioritizing adaptability, a postmodern theoretical framework can enhance our understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by digital technologies in the EU context, ultimately contributing to more inclusive, democratic and responsive forms of digital citizenship and public discourse. However, as this article shows, the synthesis of a postmodern perspective and digital technologies can also bring its own challenges, such as fragmentation, epistemological uncertainty or ethical dilemmas. Addressing these challenges requires critical engagement with both postmodern theories and digital technologies, acknowledging their complexities and contradictions while striving to promote ethical and inclusive uses of digital technology that empower EU citizens. © 2024 The Author(s)"

This research investigates how individuals and households can contribute to sustainability transitions through grassroots innovations. Specifically, we ask: How do digital gift economies facilitate changes in household consumption practices and contribute to broader sustainability transitions? To address this question, we present an instructional case study of the Buy Nothing Project (BNP), a globally scaled yet locally focused digital gift economy, as a grassroots innovation enabling citizen agency within domestic spaces. BNP is a socio-technical network of hyperlocal, digital gift-giving groups that advocate for community reliance and generosity to reduce household consumption and waste and build neighbourhood bonds. Our analysis reveals that BNP's most revolutionary aspect lies in the embedded everyday sustainability practices it facilitates, particularly the social learning to reduce consumption at individual, household, and community levels through group participation and ongoing membership. We argue that this grassroots innovation enables citizen agency within domestic spaces, contributing significantly to sustainability transitions. Paradoxically, the ordinariness of these practices, combined with the gendered composition of members and that acquiring and disposing of household goods is usually considered “women's work”, may hinder recognition of BNP's potential as a powerful catalyst for sustainable transitions. This study contributes to our understanding of how digital platforms can support household-level innovations in sustainability practices and highlights the importance of recognising and valuing diverse forms of contribution to sustainability transitions. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Based on the panel data of 290 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2022, this paper adopts the quasi-natural experiment of “sports and leisure characteristic towns in China” (SLT) to construct a difference-in-differences model and empirically evaluate the mechanism of rural sports tourism and sustainable development of destinations. The results show that: (1) the development of rural sports tourism is conducive to promoting the overall sustainable development of the destination, and the effect is more significant in the western and eastern regions. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests; (2) Mechanism analysis found that rural sports tourism promoted the optimization of industrial structure, residents' values, infrastructure construction, and grassroots governance efficiency, and thus promoted the sustainable development of destinations.

Despite ongoing efforts to pilot disaster insurance in Malawi, adoption by households remains low. This study examines factors influencing the adoption of disaster insurance in Malawi, a country highly susceptible to climate-related impacts. Drawing on qualitative research across seven districts and guided by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, the study identifies key opportunities and barriers to insurance uptake. It stresses the importance of awareness raising, integration with existing services, and partnerships in promoting insurance adoption. Additionally, the study explores novel approaches, including communities applying disaster insurance knowledge to design local risk pooling mechanisms, integrating insurance into existing projects, and designing hybrid indices for risk assessment and premium calculation. These offer insights into the potential synergies between formal insurance schemes and grassroots initiatives. However, challenges such as limited awareness, affordability constraints, absence of enabling policy and legal frameworks, and capacity gaps in the local insurance industry hinder widespread adoption. Addressing these barriers requires targeted interventions, including awareness campaigns, innovative financing mechanisms, and policy reforms.

We argue that to understand the impact of transnational feminist mobilization, at least two distinct types of feminist mobilization require further conceptual development and empirical exploration in the transnational context, namely, autonomous as contrasted with multilateral mobilization. We offer a conceptual framework for distinguishing and studying these two forms. Further, using a mixed-methods study design, we empirically distinguish domestic and transnational dimensions of feminist activism and illuminate the impact of both multilateral feminist organizing and autonomous feminist organizing in the transnational space. Our analysis reveals that domestic and transnational organizing are distinct but related phenomena. We also find that in online organizing spaces, autonomous feminist campaigns amplify the messaging of geographically dispersed grassroots and individual activists more than multilateral ones. It further suggests that autonomous movements may offer more potential for representing marginalized groups of women, though this potential may not always be realized.

Specifically, the study addressed the facilitating effect of ICTAI on students' scholarly performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised the quasi-experimental approach. A sample of 255 senior secondary school students was the analysis unit. A teacher-made performance test was used as an instrument for the study. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics for the research questions, and hypotheses tested with paired sample t-test statistics. Findings: The study results indicated that ICTAI improved student scholarly performance. The study also proved that gender had an impact on student academic performance. Research limitations/implications: Not all the students in intact classes that were used for conducting the study/research, and the background and gender of research assistants were not considered, and these could have affected the result of the study. The study implications are that this study is a piece of deeper ingenuity and innovation that provides an additional source of information to study. The study provided proof that innovative activity-based instructions such as computer-assisted instruction (CAI) boost students’ performance. Practical implications: On the instructor, the study findings demonstrated the significant effect of ICTAI on the scholarly performance of CE students. Consequently, this study contends that CE instructors/teachers can benefit from the implications of these findings by comprehensively understanding that ICTIA usage enhances student performance and, thus, improves the students' performance. Additionally, the study's findings proved that gender affected students' performance when instructed with ICTAI. The study implies that CE instructors/teachers should pay special attention to students' gender, specifically female students, as gender affects the improvement of students' CE performance when instructed with ICTAI. Originality/value: The study findings contribute to the literature on academic improvement and performance of CE students by enhancing the understanding of the effect of ICTAI on students' scholarly performance. The study recognises the existing gaps in previous literature and vivid understanding of the effect of ICTAI on students' performance and gender as a mediator. © 2023, Rachael Oke Misan-Ruppee, Sunday Obro and Williams Pius Akpochafo."

The social networking enables to set up re- lations among the people (called actors) who share common interests, activities or connections. An actor or a person plays a predominant role in sharing social networking services, hence optimal provision of web service to actors is essential. Web service is an important area of research which enables actors to acquire required services over devices such as smartphone, laptop, etc. In this paper, we present a Social Network based Web Service (SNWS) by considering actor’s characteristic features such as personal information, professional information, social status, etc. along with relation among the actors. The designed SNWS is tested over an Agriculture Social Network (ASN) which constitutes a set of actors along with their characteristic features and the relations among the actors, and renders the required web service such as Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to actors. Results are obtained for accuracy of the Actor Relational Model (ARM), and the average service time required by a set of actors. The proposed Actor Relational Model is accurate, and there is significant improvement in the average service time. Introduction: focuses on leveraging social networks to connect farmers, suppliers, and stakeholders for improved collaboration. It facilitates real-time information sharing, resource optimization, and knowledge dissemination. The framework enhances agricultural productivity by fostering community-driven solutions and personalized support. By integrating technology and social engagement, it bridges gaps in accessibility and service delivery. Objectives: To establish a platform for seamless interaction and real-time communication between farmers, suppliers, agricultural experts, and policymakers, To optimize the sharing of agricultural resources, knowledge, and best practices among stakeholders, thereby improving efficiency and productivity, To provide data-driven insights and recommendations through analytics, enabling better decision-making in agriculture, To foster active participation and collaboration among stakeholders, addressing common challenges and developing collective solutions, To integrate modern technologies such as IoT, sensors, and data analytics for providing farmers with tailored recommendations and enhancing farming practices, To bridge gaps in access to critical agricultural information, tools, and market opportunities, especially for small-scale farmers. Methods: The methodology involves designing a web-based platform that integrates social networking features with advanced agricultural tools and services. The framework leverages user profiles to categorize actors such as farmers, suppliers, experts, and policymakers, enabling targeted engagement and collaboration. Data collection through IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and user-generated content feeds into a centralized system for real-time analysis and decision-making. Algorithms are employed to match stakeholders with relevant resources, market opportunities, and expert advice. The system also incorporates communication tools, including forums, messaging, and video conferencing, to facilitate interaction. A pilot implementation phase with select agricultural communities is conducted to test the framework’s effectiveness, followed by iterative improvements based on user feedback and performance metrics. The final framework aims to enhance connectivity, streamline resource sharing, and empower stakeholders through a scalable and user-friendly platform. Results: The implementation is for Optimal Actor Engagement for Enhancing Connectivity and Service in Agriculture"" demonstrated significant improvements in stakeholder collaboration and resource optimization. Farmers reported increased access to real-time information, expert advice, and market opportunities, leading to better decision-making and productivity gains. The platform facilitated faster communication between actors, reducing response times for critical issues such as pest outbreaks or weather-related challenges. Additionally, the use of analytics enabled tailored recommendations, improving resource utilization and promoting sustainable farming practices. Pilot studies showed a notable increase in farmer engagement, with measurable improvements in crop yields, cost savings, and market reach. The framework also strengthened the linkages between policymakers and grassroots actors, leading to more inclusive and effective agricultural strategies. Overall, the results highlighted the platform's potential to revolutionize agricultural connectivity and services. Conclusions: the work successfully bridges the gap between agricultural stakeholders, fostering real-time collaboration, resource optimization, and informed decision-making. By leveraging modern technologies and social networking features, the framework enhances productivity, sustainability, and market access while empowering farmers and communities.

Evaluating students’ DL is crucial for providing valuable insights to guide future educational initiatives. This study aims to develop a set of indicators and a validated questionnaire to assess students’ DL effectively. Based on the DL framework developed by the research team, which delineates eight key dimensions of DL (“access and understanding,” “evaluation,” “ethics and well-being,” “interaction,” “collaboration,” “creating,” “problem-solving,” and “civic engagement and responsibility”), the study distributed the questionnaire to 1,585 primary and secondary school students in Taiwan. This sample included 748 participants in the pre-test phase and 837 in the post-test phase. Through a rigorous process of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the questionnaire demonstrated robust measurement properties and validated the underlying theoretical framework. The Cronbach’s alpha scores ranged from 0.747 to 0.877, indicating high reliability. Analysis of student responses revealed a generally favourable level of DL proficiency, with the “ethics and well-being” dimension receiving the highest scores, followed by “access and understanding.” In contrast, “creating” and “civic engagement and responsibility” received the lowest ratings among the eight dimensions. These findings suggest that students primarily assume passive roles as digital “consumers,” with less emphasis on active engagement as “creators” or “innovators.” The developed questionnaire serves as a valuable instrument for evaluating students’ DL competencies, providing insights into their digital engagement tendencies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025."

While embracing the potential of digital technologies, it is crucial to have a realistic understanding of the practical, ethical, and cultural considerations for implementing youth discourse in cultural heritage management and empowering youth initiatives in decision-making. Little research has focused on assessing youth digital participation in cultural heritage management for its impacts on fostering inclusivity, enhancing the levels of youth engagement, gauging the potential of digitalization, and facilitating youth initiatives. This paper fills the gap by developing an assessment framework for youth digital participation, comprising four criteria and thirty-five indicators. These indicators were validated through expert consultation and multivariate analysis and categorized into four groups based on their levels of priority. The framework provides detailed guidelines for applying these indicators across different phases of participation—envisioning, monitoring, and evaluating. Additionally, four recommendations derived from the framework provide suggestions on critical aspects of youth digital participation and guidelines to foster the impact of youth engagement in future participatory practices in cultural heritage management. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, these grassroots efforts often confront challenges such as spatial inadequacies caused by bureaucratic zoning policies and the scarcity of affordable real estate. Moreover, urban landscapes struggle with the abandonment and underutilization of public buildings and open spaces, hindered by complex administrative protocols and limited resource affecting both private developers and local governments. This study introduces a model for urban policy design, named the “NeighbourHUB” model (N-HUB), aimed at addressing these issues by aligning space demand with community activities through Participatory Cost-Benefit Analysis and collaborative design approaches. Developed by a multidisciplinary team from the University of Cagliari, in collaboration with 30 local community associations active in the neighbourhoods where the model was tested, N-HUB advocates for a gradual, incremental, and place-based approach to optimize space utilization and enhance coordination between local authorities and socio-cultural associations. The findings of case study application presented in this paper demonstrate its potential to improve transparency, accessibility, and usability of spaces, providing guidance for fair urban policy design and effective conflict resolution. © 2024 The Authors"

The increased reliance on the flow of data facilitated by digital technologies has often reproduced existing inequalities through invisibility, oversimplification, or incomplete data sets. In contexts of urban informality, invisibility is particularly pervasive in self-built communities that are deemed illegible to and by the state and are subjected to neglect and removals, reinforcing historical patterns of oppression, exclusion, and racism in residents’ everyday lives. Similarly, insurgent planning illuminates grassroots efforts challenging systems and structures of oppression to spur change and collective urban rights. In the last few decades, the appropriation of digital tools and resources has allowed communities and movements to redefine their organizing means with digital tools and platforms, producing, expanding, and documenting urban insurgencies. This article puts forward a Digital Insurgency conceptual framework to highlight insurgent processes of knowledge production, organizing, and appropriation of digital and technological means that challenge hegemonic systems of oppression while advocating for collective urban rights. Case studies in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Fortaleza, Brazil, are analyzed through the proposed framework, considering movements’ political foundation, agency, practical implementations, utilization of digital and technological tools, and the crafting of counter-hegemonic narratives. The selected cases demonstrate the robust potential of Digital Insurgency in supporting the struggles for urban collective rights and social and spatial justice through grassroots digitalization of urban insurgency. © The Author(s) 2025."
