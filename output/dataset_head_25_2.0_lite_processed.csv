After pointing out Goffman's singular conception of the “interaction order,” the author shows how institutional organizers and ordinary citizens deal with interactional ambiguity, in its contrasting effects on the dynamics of these participatory assemblies. A primary form of ambiguity, between a “representative” and a “deliberative” definition of participatory democracy, is proving inhibiting for citizens' involvement and tends to “suspend interaction.” A second type of ambiguity arises from a wide range of facilitation methods (playful, dramaturgical, educational, therapeutic, esthetic, etc.) designed to transform the initial ambiguity to offer more fluid interaction and more stimulating involvement opportunities, yet in an activity that now has only an uncertain connection to civic participation. The author concludes by presenting some frame-analytical tools for tracking and evaluating dynamics of ambiguity transformation in participatory processes and emphasizes the implications of this type of sociological analysis for political theory. © 2024 Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI).",30,"Focuses on participatory processes and democratic ambiguity, not a case study involving a tech project."

The research used L. Starkey’s test of critical thinking, observation, and conversation to study the ability to comprehend texts critically. Such criteria as the ability to argue a position, the depth of the analysis, the independence of the analysis, the level of difference between the results of one’s own cognitive search and theoretical constructs from textbooks, and the quality of reflection were studied. Each of the criteria was evaluated at three levels—low, medium and high. The formative experiment made it possible to test the formulated hypothesis. The experiment’s independent variable is a system of exercises aimed at developing critical thinking, which involves the use of multimedia technologies. The dependent variable is the critical thinking of education seekers. In general, the research hypotheses were confirmed, as the experimental programme demonstrated effectiveness depending on the students’ year of study. A gradual increase in the values of the studied components during undergraduate studies is recorded. The developed programme began to partially demonstrate effectiveness starting from the second year, and the greatest positive effect was recorded in the fourth year. The use of multimedia technologies provided additional developmental opportunities for the development of critical thinking in students’ work with text material. At the same time, critical reading of texts turned out to be more sensitive to pedagogical influence, compared to critical thinking in general. The obtained data can be used to strengthen the developmental effect of educational programmes of HEIs. In particular, experimental data will help to optimize the teaching of educational components in the context of developing students’ critical thinking and active civic position in the information field. The practical aspect of increasing distance learning opportunities is especially important. Further research prospects are to determine the effectiveness of using multimedia technologies for the development of students’ critical thinking when studying different academic subjects. © 2024 by the author(s).

As the phenomenon is widely recognized in papers presenting singular case studies and broader analyses in the field, selecting such serious games with certain characteristics remains unclear. The informed process of choosing games with particular properties regarding genesis, graphic style, genre, and complexity as the response for specified needs and process assumptions appears to be supportive in preventing unnecessary costs and data overproduction. Such avoidance is an important part of sustainable digital transformation. Therefore, there is a need for a more conscious process of selecting video games to be used in a participatory process. The following paper aims to propose a numerical base for a decisional instrument that could be useful for specifying the characteristics of games to be utilized in participation. They performed a multicriteria analysis of documented cases of implementing video games in civic engagement, allowing the creation of a set of numeric indicators that help determine the properties of games that will be most appropriate for given process assumptions.

The relevance of the study is determined by the need to develop prosocial behavior in young people as one of the main conditions for developing harmonious social relations in modern Russian society. The global trend toward implementing the idea of prosociality in education as a tool for developing prosocial communities is supported by leading global institutions and projects focused on the education system and upbringing of young people (for example, OECD Future of Education and Skills 2030, Global Education Futures). The study aims to identify the regulatory conditions for developing prosociality in a modern Russian comprehensive school. Materials and methods. The source base of the study was the regulatory documents defining the state policy of the Russian Federation in the field of education and upbringing in comprehensive schools (federal laws, decrees of the government of the Russian Federation, the Federal State Educational Standard of Basic General Education, the Concepts of academic subjects “Fundamentals of the Spiritual and Moral Culture of the Peoples of Russia”, “History of Russia”, “Social Science”, methodological recommendations and materials developed by the Ministry of Education, and administrative documents of the central education authorities in the Russian Federation). During the study, a systematic approach was used, as well as scientific research methods: textual analysis, the comparison method, and the historical and genetic method. Results. The studied corpus of documents displayed normative regulation of activities to develop prosociality as a moral quality in line with the paradigm of the humanistic nature of education. Forming the civic activity of schoolchildren as an integral part of prosocial behavior is possible through the participation of schoolchildren in solving national problems, primarily in the format of volunteering. The greatest attention in Russian legislation is paid to issues of patriotic education of youth. Conclusion. A phenomenon of modern education is prosocial attitudes being introduced into the consciousness of young people, understood as a person’s ability to help others, take an active civic position, and act in the external environment. © 2024 LLC Ecological Help.

Unlike Vesuvius and Stromboli, the Phlegraean Fields threat is not readily visible, and public awareness of volcanic danger and the civic emergency plan is correspondingly quite limited. Recent increased levels of regional seismic activity have concentrated attention on enhancing public volcano risk awareness, especially among younger generations. Recognizing the influential role of the younger demographic in societal scientific awareness, effective language and engagement strategies become paramount. In this context, Serious Games, which balance serious and playful elements, emerge as an innovative science communication tool actively involving participants and enhancing their learning experience. Integral to risk analysis is the use of downward counterfactual analysis, a cognitive psychology concept that prompts a deliberate examination of how events might have taken a more adverse turn. This approach contributes to enhanced disaster preparedness, particularly for extreme natural risks such as volcanic eruptions. An interactive Victorian parlor game was designed for the 2023 edition of the Science Fair “Futuro Remoto” in Bagnoli, in the Phlegraean Fields. This game aims to elevate risk awareness, offering participants an instructive and engaging experience focused on counterfactual thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills development.

At present, many performance appraisal methods lack objectivity and fairness, which is not conducive to the long-term development of enterprises. Therefore, more research into scientific and effective performance appraisal methods is required. This study takes the grassroots employees of Enterprise A as an example, improving the existing performance appraisal evaluation indices to evaluate employee performance from three dimensions, including achievement, ability, and attitude, as determined by index weights using the analytic hierarchy process approach. An improved backpropagation neural network (BPNN) method is then designed to obtain performance appraisal and evaluation results. The error between the output of the improved BPNN method and expected output was small. Of the 20 extracted samples, the maximum and minimum error values were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively, and the average error was 0.03. The improved BPNN method evaluated only one out of 20 samples incorrectly, and the accuracy of the improved BPNN method was 96.21%, which is 19.88% and 10.75% higher than those of support vector machine and standard BPNN, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the improved BPNN method can be used in the appraisal and assessment of enterprise employee performance and has practical application value. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.",0,Unrelated to civic tech; focuses on enterprise employee performance.

It emphasizes the importance of placing nonviolent activities within leadership frameworks that prioritize collectivity, collaboration, adaptiveness, authenticity, and community interactions. It argues that non-violent activism can serve as a cornerstone of democratic practices, and plausible to a myriad of challenges in civic spaces. The assertion that violence is not a prerequisite for gaining the attention of authorities capable of enacting societal change is supported by several studies. This paper advocates for a reorientation of collaborative efforts between those in positions of authority and civil society leaders to foster progress. There is power in the decibel of voices of the people, to correct acts of omission and commission that is impacting negatively on the citizens. In context characterized by volatility and fragility, the paper suggests prioritizing the process of influencing, mobilizing and organizing responsive interventions rather than solely focusing on the ends or outcomes. Process-oriented approach creates containers for curiosity, relational, and experimental practices that interweave multi-dimensional perspectives. The social change actors navigated cultural and structural barriers to implement non-violent strategies, offering a compelling example of grassroots peace building. Overall, this paper findings underscores the significance of understanding both direct and structural violence in shaping citizen’s right within specific context. It highlights the efficacy of context-based leadership practices in promoting non-violent organizing for peace, particularly in hyperlocal settings. Moreover, it suggests that these findings could inform indigenous peace building that is inherently influenced by contextual factors. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a case study, I was able to elucidate a context-based leadership model advanced by local women that averted a probable political violence in Nigeria. A case study approach was adopted because it is a phenomenon that is bounded in time, context and advanced by a particular group of change agents. A case study with a constructivist approach was utilized to understand the context and sense making of the “why” and the “what”. In situatedness, the natural occurring data was cultivated, including one-on-one indepth interviews. Data was analyzed using a narrative analysis, which raised themes on resilience, collectivity, collaboration, risk and sustainability. The findings pivot a culturally based experience of leadership by women in a fragile context. First, I provided a contextual background, explaining the local context, including the socio-economic, cultural, political and historical factors that contributed to the emergence of the conflict. In addition, I explained the scope and nature of the conflict, describing the grievances and issues that led to the tensions within the community, and highlighting the key actors and stakeholders involved. Secondly, I analyzed the non-violent strategies and tactics employed by a group of social change actors to address the issue which involved non-violent protest, tactical community organizing, dialogic engagements and creative forms of interventions. Thirdly, I evaluated and explained the role of leadership in coordinating non-violent activities and actions, the effectiveness of their leadership style, relational and processual, that sustained the non -violent approach, and the challenges the group encountered. In addition, I explained the outcome from such leadership practice and lessons learned, with evidence of a dismantling of power dynamics, and shift in attitude to a non-violent disposition. Lastly, I explained how this approach may have broader implications for understanding nonviolent conflict resolution, social movements, and the promotion of peace and justice in local contexts and beyond. Findings: A leadership practice that is relational and collective should have consideration for both the context where the leadership is exercised and deliberate on the processes necessary to hold containers for everyone to engage. This is gradually dismantling the hegemonic conceptualization of peace building, with a gradual shift of co-construction and sense making of peace building, with implication for more diversity and inclusion of persons and perspectives. It also underscores a system that deconstructs and departs form colonized thinking and contributes to conditions that enables and inspires alternative approaches to addressing oppressive power structures. (1) In unstable situations, leadership frequently arises from within communities, driven by individuals and groups intimately connected to their realities. The Nassarawan women embody this grassroots leadership, marked by wisdom, resilience, and a dedication to creating positive change despite significant obstacles. They embrace non-violent strategies, inspired by past successes, recognizing their potency in effecting change. (2) The leadership of these women illustrates the importance of mobilizing collective strength for justice and equality, showcasing how local leadership can catalyze transformative change for the better. (3) Indigenous styles of leadership possess the capacity to go beyond conventional concepts and embrace intricacy, flexibility, and inclusiveness. A multi-faceted leadership strategy becomes especially pertinent as it enables individuals to navigate complexity, confront challenges, and cultivate resilience within their communities, rather than depending solely on traditional methods.(4) The practice of peace leadership isn’t necessarily linked to official positions, titles, or authority. Rather, it appears as a continuous, intentional effort within community interactions, often arising from unexpected situations and sources. Research limitations/implications: Most of the women engaged in this leadership activity are located in remote areas, and this research had access to only a few who storied their experiences in ways they understood how to. Practical implications: With the rapid shift and call for more non-violent activism, we must be open to sample the different textures relevant for varied conditions. This holds a huge implication for understanding the psychology of communities expressing the full human agency in exercising leadership that is contextually driven. The connection between local struggles and global movements for social justice and human rights is profound and multifaceted. Firstly, there’s a shared value across movements for equity, equality, justice, dignity, and human rights, spanning issues like environmental protection, gender equality, racial justice, and indigenous rights. Local movements increasingly emphasize building solidarity across borders, collaborating with similar movements worldwide through actions like protests and social media campaigns. This amplifies local voices on a global stage and underscores the interconnectedness of struggles. The leadership of the women’s group holds significant implications for global movements, offering insights into grassroots perspectives on social issues. Their localized knowledge enriches global discourse on social change, providing tangible examples of challenges faced by marginalized groups and culturally relevant solutions. Additionally, their commitment to nonviolent methods establishes a platform for marginalized voices and fosters solidarity across diverse communities. The group’s innovative approaches, drawing upon local resources and grassroots networks, demonstrate the power of community-driven solutions to address social problems. Moreover, their grassroots empowerment shifts power dynamics within communities and influences broader systemic transformations, all while advocating for justice through peaceful means. These practices not only spark global solidarity but also shape public discourse and policy agendas at state and national levels, highlighting the human rights implications of local issues like political corruption. Overall, the women’s group exemplifies the transformative potential of grassroots activism in effecting lasting change on a global scale. Social implications: The power for everyday peace leadership rests with the people and it is translated into meaningful outcomes when everyone has the opportunity to lead. Originality/value: Research has been done on many women led movement in Nigeria, but this is unique, as it changed the narrative for an approach that was successful in shifting cultural boundaries in very fragile and uncertain context. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",75,"The abstract describes a case study of non-violent activism, leadership, and community engagement, all of which align with the goals of civic technology.

Especially in traditional villages with national protection status, the cognitive differences between individuals and the state aggravate the conflicts and trust crisis between grassroots organizations and villagers in the construction of rural housing. Simmel believes that trust is a leap of knowledge and belief under the joint action of rationality and sensibility. Many scholars have tried to analyze and deconstruct the “leap of trust” from multiple disciplines, but there are few practical cases, and the specific path with the rural background of China is not clear. The purpose of this study is to study the reconstruction of trust in village by focusing on the co-construction of villages, because the mode of co-construction of village is not only in line with traditional cultural customs, but also the main trend of promoting rural development in China. Based on the empirical investigation of rural housing construction in Tangfang Village, Yunnan Province, China, this paper studies the links among trust remodeling, university participation and multi-subject co-construction, and explores the elements and path of trust construction under the intervention of the third party of universities in rural construction. The empirical analysis points out that there are six elements of trust construction in the multi-subject co-construction of traditional village, including moral integrity, interest relationship, knowledge and technology, achievement expectation, value sharing and daily interaction, and the dynamic process of rural trust construction accompanied by multi-subjects eating, living and working together goes through four stages, namely, no trust, rational trust, experience trust and deep trust. There are two conclusions in this paper. Firstly, participating in rural construction can construct the trust relationship between university team members and villagers. Secondly, as a third-party media, universities can help to rebuild the trust relationship between villagers and grassroots organizations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",30,Discusses rural construction and trust but lacks focus on a civic tech project or software/hardware implementation.

In the early nineteenth century, with Manchester rapidly becoming the ‘world’s first industrial city’, we see emerging at the same time a vibrant urban educational landscape, with no parallel in the British Isles at that time.1 In contrast to England’s ancient universities which remained, for the most part, closed and private entities until the mid-nineteenth century, Manchester’s educational culture was self-consciously diffused, civic and participatory, strongly influenced by the city’s prominent dissenting communities. Excluded from Oxford and Cambridge, Manchester’s Unitarians, in particular, sought to shape the city’s educational culture according to the Enlightenment ideal of polite learning as a public endeavour.
